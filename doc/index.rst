Pre-commit hooks
****************

Hartree Centre pre-commit hooks to use across multiple projects - these have
been developed to hopefully make life simpler, so please raise an issue on
`our repository <https://github.com/stfc/pre-commit-hooks>`_
if you're finding they're more hassle than you'd like!

Documentation for our current hooks are available on the left hand side of
this page.

TODO: add a worked example of creating a new hook

TODO: add instructions on how to use these hooks within pre-commit-config.yaml
